When I called and cancelled the payment THEY TOOK, I was told to wait 5-7 days for my money to be back on my card. I called my bank 4 days after I called and my bank told me that DOORDASH ISSUED A REFUND THEN CANCELLED THE ISSUED REFUND. When I called yesterday about this they tried saying they have a receipt of the issued refund. My lawyer is working on the case",1,2025-09-27 16:38:50

Granted, the cost of a meal and a few Dashed items can easily run $60+ after a fair tip for the Dasher but with the current prices of food in general after Post-Covid Inflation I don't save much getting out to the market and preparing a full meal anyways. Plus I'm a paraplegic which makes this service a true blessing on those tough days/weeks. The subscription is fair too.",5,2025-09-27 16:20:34

The fact that y'all don't hold people accountable for their actions a refund is not acceptable at all. long as they have a car they can deliver food. background check needs to be completed. a new system of how food is handled needs to place in order and hold the delivery driver and the restaurant or grocery store accountable for these things. not fair.,1,2025-09-09 22:34:47

677e592196da447ddb6fd228c624c042,google_play,customer,Doordash is not top tier - Lacks accurate updates for driver and person ordering. The driver can receive multiple orders from Door Dash but still show the driver coming directly to you. This causes the customer to think the driver isn't delivering on time. Delivery time updates negatively impact the driver and the person ordering. Hey DoorDash - use Uber Eats for a master class in how to accurately update your customers food orders.
